# EIP-3: Deregister Dapp Canisters

## Proposal Summary

De-registration of DApp Frontend Asset Canister for Improved Development

This proposal aims to deregister the Frontend canister (gpdbs-xqaaa-aaaah-adtiq-cai) from the ELNA SNS and transfer control to the ELNA development team (dgdx5-dxusi-ektqy-qgkk5-szno7-qsmp6-hy4ev-qkiiv-7te5h-ga5qz-jqe).

This action is necessary as upgrading the front-end canister via the SNS proposal process proves to be challenging.
